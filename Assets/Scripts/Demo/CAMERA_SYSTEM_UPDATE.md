## ðŸŽ® **NEW CAMERA CONTROLS**

### **Primary Control**

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED**

- âœ… **Auto Return**: Releasing V smoothly returns camera to player
- âœ… **Death State**: Camera stays in pan mode when player dies
- âœ… **Respawn Return**: Camera automatically follows player on respawn

### **UI Updates**

## ðŸŽ¯ **HOW TO TEST THE NEW SYSTEM**

### **Test Player Movement**
1. Press Play in Unity
2. Use **WASD** to move player around
3. âœ… Player should move smoothly, camera follows

### **Test Camera Panning**  
1. **Hold V** key
2. Use **Arrow Keys** or **Right Mouse** to pan camera
3. **Release V** - camera should return to player smoothly
4. âœ… Player movement (WASD) works independently

### **Test Death State**
1. Press **K** to simulate player death
2. Camera enters free pan mode automatically
3. Use **Arrow Keys** or **Right Mouse** to look around
4. Press **K** again to respawn
5. âœ… Camera should return to following player

### **Test Zoom**
1. **Hold V** to enter pan mode
2. Use **Scroll Wheel** to zoom in/out
3. âœ… Zoom should work smoothly

## ðŸš€ **GAMEPLAY BENEFITS**

### **Intuitive Controls**
- **Clear separation**: V for camera, WASD for movement
- **Hold behavior**: Must hold V - prevents accidental camera control
- **Auto return**: Always returns to player when released

### **Death State Handling**
- **Strategic viewing**: When dead, can scout area with camera
- **Automatic transition**: No manual camera switching needed
- **Seamless respawn**: Camera automatically follows on respawn

### **No Input Conflicts**
- **Player movement**: WASD always controls player
- **Camera panning**: Separate controls (Arrow Keys/Mouse)
- **Predictable behavior**: Each control does exactly what expected
