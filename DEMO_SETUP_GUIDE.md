# 🎮 MemeOArena Demo Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. Open `Assets/Scenes/Game.unity`
2. Create an empty GameObject called "Demo Manager"

## 📋 Manual Setup

If you prefer manual control:

### Step 1: Player Setup
```
1. Create empty GameObject "Demo Player"
2. Add `DemoPlayerController` component
3. Set tag to "Player"
4. Position at (0, 0, 0)

Optional Visual:
- Add child Capsule primitive as "Visual"
- Remove CapsuleCollider from visual
- Apply blue material
```

### Step 2: Camera Setup
```
1. Ensure Main Camera exists with "MainCamera" tag
2. Add `CameraController` component to camera
3. Set Target to Demo Player transform
4. Set Camera Mode to "Third Person"
5. Adjust followSpeed (recommended: 6-8)
```

### Step 3: Environment Setup
```
1. Create Plane primitive as "Ground"
2. Scale to (5, 1, 5)
3. Position at (0, -0.5, 0)
4. Apply green material

Optional:
- Add cube primitives as targets around the scene
- Position at radius 8 units from center
```

### Step 4: Debug UI (Optional)
```
1. Create empty GameObject "Debug UI"
2. Add `CameraControlsUI` component
3. Add `DemoInstructionsUI` component
```
