## 🎮 Integration with Existing Systems

All new systems are **fully compatible** with your existing MemeOArena code:

### **Existing GameLogger → EnterpriseLogger**
```csharp
// Old code still works:
GameLogger.LogStateTransition(tick, playerId, "FSM", "Idle", "Moving");

// New enterprise features available:
EnterpriseLogger.LogInfo("GAMEPLAY", playerId, "Player spawned", tick);
```

### **Manual Memory Management → Automatic**
```csharp
// Before: Manual cleanup
var resource = new SomeResource();
// ... forgot to dispose, memory leak!

// After: Automatic RAII
using var resource = someResource.AsManaged();
// Automatically disposed, no leaks possible
```

### **Direct References → Event-Driven**
```csharp
// Before: Tight coupling
playerController.OnDeath += uiManager.ShowDeathScreen;

// After: Decoupled events
EventBus.Subscribe<PlayerDeathEvent>(ui => uiManager.ShowDeathScreen());
EventBus.Publish(new PlayerDeathEvent(tick, playerId));
```
